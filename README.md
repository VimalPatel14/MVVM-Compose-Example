# MVVM-Compose-Example
Android #JetpackCompose #MVVM #Hilt #Flow #Kotlin

A simple Android project demonstrating **MVVM** architecture with **Jetpack Compose**. This app fetches and displays data (posts and users) using **Flow** and **Hilt** for dependency injection. The project shows how to handle UI states and navigate between screens using Compose, while leveraging best practices like ViewModel, Repository, and UseCase layers.

## Features:
- MVVM architecture
- Jetpack Compose UI
- Flow for reactive data handling
- Hilt for Dependency Injection
- Simple navigation with state management

## Demo
The app demonstrates how to handle both posts and users, allowing users to navigate between screens with a button press. It also shows how to handle back presses to return to the main screen.

### Technologies:
- **Android Jetpack Compose**
- **MVVM Architecture**
- **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**
- **Hilt for Dependency Injection**
- **LiveData & StateFlow**
